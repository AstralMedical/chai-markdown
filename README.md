# chai-markdown
Here be dragons/regex hacks.

Provides a simple framework for transforming markdown ontop of the [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) converter and binding into an element through an attribute, similar to [btf-markdown](https://github.com/btford/angular-markdown-directive).

Currently configured to add a `target='blank'` to all links.
